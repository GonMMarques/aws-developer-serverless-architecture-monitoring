## Code used to complete the AWS Developer: Serveless Architecture and Monitoring

The scope of the course is to know more about effectively deploying applications to AWS and securing your AWS infrastructure. It was built on AW services like:
- Lambda
- API Gateway
- Kinesis
- X-Ray
- CloudWatch

For more info check out the [original repository](https://github.com/ryanmurakami/trash-panda-buffet) and also check the [AWS Developer: Serveless Architecture and Monitoring course on Pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-developer-serverless-architecture-monitoring). 

I highly recommend this course if you are getting started (like me on) the AWS world!
